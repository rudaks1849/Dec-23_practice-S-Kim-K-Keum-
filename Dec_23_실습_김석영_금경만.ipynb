We don't know.\\nDr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hour ago.\\nNASA didn't authorize Selvig to pull the test phase.\\nHe wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous advancement\\nIt just turned itself on?\\nWhat are the engine levels now?\\nClimbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered the evac.\\nHow long to get everyone out?\\nCampus should be clear in the next half hour.\\nDo better.\\nSir, evacuation maybe futile.\\nWe should tell them to go back to sleep?\\nIf we can't control the Tesseract's energy,\\nthere may not be a minimum safe distance.\\nI need you to make sure that phase\\nSir, is that really a priority right now?\\nUntil such time as the world ends,\\nwe will act as though it intends to spin on.\\nClear out the tech below. Every piece of phase 2 on a truck and gone.\\nYes, sir. Come with me.\\nTalk to me, Doctor.\\n- Director.\\n- Is there anything we know for certain?\\n- Tesseract is misbehaving.\\n- Is that supposed to be funny?\\nNo, it's not funny at all.\\nThe Tesseract is not only active, she's...misbehaving.\\n-How soon until you pull the plug?\\nShe's an energy source.\\nIf we turn off the power, she turns it back on.\\n- If she reaches peak level...\\n- We've prepared for this, doctor.\\n- Harnessing energy from space.\\n- We don't have the harness.\\nOur calculations are far from complete.\\nNow she's throwing off interference, radiation\\nNothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.\\nThat can be harmful.\\nWhere's Agent Barton?\\nThe Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.\\nAgent Barton, report to me.\\nI gave you this detail so you could\\nkeep a close eye on things.\\n- I can see better from a distance.\\n- Are you seeing anything that might\\n- set this thing off?\\n- Doctor, it's spiking again.\\nNo one come or gone.\\nIt's oven is clean.\\nNo contacts, no I.M.'s.\\nIf there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.\\n- At this end?\\n- A cube of space, one end of the door.\\nYeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides.\\nSir, please put down the spear!\\nYou have a heart.\\nPlease don't.\\n- I still need that.\\n- This doesn't have to get any messier.\\nOf course it does.

Freedom is life's great lie.\\nOnce you accept that, in your heart...\\nYou will know peace.\\nYeah, you say peace, I kind of\\nthink you mean the other piece.\\nSir, Director Fury is stalling.\\nThis place is about to blow\\nDrop a hundred feet of raw material,\\nhe means to bury us.\\n- Like The Pharaohs of Odin.\\n- He was right.\\nHe's right, the portal is collapsing in on itself.\\nYou got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.\\nDrop him.\\nNeed these vehicles.\\n- Who's that?\\n- He didn't tell me.\\nHill, do you copy? Barton is....\\nHe's got the Tesseract! Track it down!\\nets go, no no no.. leave leave, go.\\nWe cleared upstairs, sir.\\nWe need to go.\\nDirector? Director Fury , do you copy?\\nThe Tesseract is with the hostile force.\\nI have men down.

I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.\\nSHIELD. How did they find me?\\nWe never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance,\\neven helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.\\n- Why?\\n- Nick Fury seems to trust you.\\nBut now I need you to come in.\\n- What if I say no?\\n- I'll persuade you.\\nAnd what if the...other guy says no?\\nYou've been more than a year without an incident.\\nI don't think you wanna break that streak.\\nI don't get every time what I want.\\nDoctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.\\n- Well, those I actively try to avoid.\\n- This is the\\nTesseract.\\nIt has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.\\n- What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?\\n- Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken.\\nIt omits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.\\nThere's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.\\nIf there was, that's where I'd be.\\n- So Fury isn't after the monster?\\n- Not that he's told me.\\nAnd he tells you everything?\\n- Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.\\n- He needs me in a cage?\\n- No one's gonna put you in a...\\n- Stop lying to me!\\nI'm sorry, that was mean.\\nI just wanted to see what you'd do.\\nWhy don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that,\\nand the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay?\\nNatasha.\\nStand down. We're good here.\\nJust you and me?\\nThis is out of line, Director.\\nYou're dealing with forces you can't control.\\nYou ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?\\nDid you feel an over abundance of control?\\nYou saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet?\\nNot Asgard. Loki.\\nHe can't be working alone.\\nWhat about the other one? His brother.\\nOur intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile.\\nBut he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help either.\\nIt's up to us.\\nWhich is why you should be focusing on phase 2,\\n- it was designed for exactly...\\n- Phase 2 isn't ready, our enemy is.\\n- We need a response team.\\n- The Avengers Initiative was shut down.\\n- This isn't about The Avengers.\\n- We have seen the list.\\nWe're running the world's greatest\\ncovert security network\\nand you're gonna leave the fate of\\nhuman race to a handful of freaks.\\nI'm not leaving anything to anyone.\\nWe need a response team.\\nThese people may be isolated, unbalanced even,\\nbut I believe with the right push\\nthey can be exactly what we need.\\n- You believe?\\n- War isn't won by sentiment, Director.\\nNo, it's won by soldiers.\\nThere's not enough time. I'm gotta\\npull into the water.\\n- You wont be alone.\\n- .Oh God.\\nThis guy is still alive.\\nTrouble sleeping?\\nI slept for 70 years, Sir.\\nI think I've had my fill.\\nThen you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.\\nI went under, the world was at war,\\nI wake up, they say we won.\\nThey didn't say what we lost.\\nWe've made some mistakes along the way.\\nSome very recently.\\n- You here with a mission, sir?\\n- I am.\\n- Trying to get me back in the world?\\n- Trying to save it.\\nHydra's secret weapon.\\nHoward Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you.\\nHe thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to\\nunlimited sustainable energy.\\nThat's something the world sorely needs.\\n- Who took it from you?\\n- He's called Loki.\\nHe's not from around here.\\nThere's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in.\\nThe world has gotten even stranger than you already know.\\nAt this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.\\nTen bucks says you're wrong.\\nThere's a debriefing package waiting\\nfor you back at your apartment.\\nIs there anything you can tell us\\nabout the Tesseract that we ought to know now?\\nYou should have left it in the ocean.\\nYou're good to go on this end.\\nThe rest is up to you.\\nYou disconnected the transition lines?\\nAre we off the grid?\\nStark Towers is about to become a\\nbeacon of self sustaining clean energy.\\nWow, so maybe our reactor takes over\\nand it actually works?\\nI assume. Light her up.\\n- How does it look?\\n- Like Christmas, but with more...me.\\nGotta go wider on the public awareness campaign.\\nYou need to do some press.\\nI can do some more tomorrow,\\nI'm working on the zoning for the next billboards.\\nPepper, you're killing me. Remember?\\nEnjoy the moment.\\nI remember.\\nSir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.\\nI'm not in. I'm actually out.\\nSir, I'm afraid he's insisting.\\nClose the line Jarvis. I got a date.\\nLevels are holding steady...I think.\\nOf course they are, I was directly involved.\\nWhich brings me to my next question.\\n- How does it feel to be a genius?\\n- Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?\\nWhat do you mean? All this, came from you.\\nNo. All this, came from that.\\nGive yourself some credit, please.\\nStark Tower -\\nStark Tower is your baby. Give yourself, twelve percent of the credit.\\n- Twelve percent?\\n- An argument can be made for fifteen.\\n- Twelve percent for my baby?\\n- Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.\\nLiterally, I lifted the heavy things.\\nAnd sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.\\n- My private elevator.\\n- You mean our elevator?\\nIt was teeming with sweaty workmen.\\nI'm going to pay for that comment about\\npercentages in some subtle way later on, aren't I?\\nNot gonna be that subtle.\\nI'll tell you what. Next building\\nis gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.\\n- On the lease.\\n- Call your mom, can you bunk over?\\nSir, the telephone. I'm afraid\\nmy protocol's are being overwritten.\\nStark, we need to talk.\\nYou have reached the life model\\ndecoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message.\\n- This is urgent.\\n- Then leave it urgently.\\n- Security breach. That's on you.\\n- Mr Stark.\\n- Phil! Come in.\\n- Phil.\\n- I can't stay.\\n- Uh...his first name is Agent.\\n- Come on in, we're celebrating.\\n- Which is why he can't stay.Soon as possible.\\n- I don't like being handed things\\n- That's alright, cause I love to be handed things.\\nSo, let's trade.\\nThank you.\\nOfficial consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.\\n- This isn't a consultation.\\n- Is this about The Avengers?\\n- Which I...I know nothing about.\\n- The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.\\n- And I didn't even qualify.\\n- I didn't know that either.\\nYeah, apparently I'm volatile, self obsessed, don't play well with others.\\n- That I did know.\\n- This isn't about personality profiles anymore.\\n- Whatever. Miss Potts, got a sec?\\n- You know, I thought we were having a moment.\\n- I was having twelve percent of a moment.\\nThis seems so serious, Phil's pretty shaken.\\n- How did you notice? Why is he Phil?\\n- What is all this?\\nThis is uh...\\nThis.\\n- I'm going to take the jet to D.C. tonight.\\n- Tomorrow.\\nYou have homework. You have a lot of homework.\\nWell, what if I didn't?\\nIf you didn't?\\nYou mean if you finished?\\nThen ...\\nSquare deal. It's the last date.\\nWork hard.\\n- Do you drive past the airport, by chance?\\n- I can drop you.\\nOh, fantastic. Does the cellist\\nYou? Is it true relationship?\\n- He moved back to Portland.\\n- What?\\nWe are a forty-minute\\nfrom the base, sir.\\nSo this Dr. Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?\\nA lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero.\\nBanner thought gammer radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula.\\n- Didn't really go his way, did it?\\n- Not so much.\\nWhen he's got that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.\\nHe's like a smart person.\\nI gotta say, it's an honor to meet you, officially.\\nI sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping.\\nI mean, I was...I was present while you were unconscious from the ice.\\nYou know, it's really, it's just a...just a huge honor to have you on board.\\n- Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.\\n- Oh, you are. Absolutely.\\nUh...we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input.\\nThe uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little...old fashioned?\\nEverything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light,\\npeople might just need a little old fashioned.\\n- The Chitauri grow restless.\\n- Let them grow restless.\\n- I will lead them in the glorious battle.\\n- Battle? Against a meagre might of earth?\\n- Glorious, not lengthy.\\nIf your force is as formidable as you claim.\\nYou question us?\\nQuestion him?\\nHe who put the scepter in your hand?\\nWho gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose?\\nWhen you were cast out, defeated!\\nI was a king! The rightful king of Asgard. Betrayed.\\nYour ambition is little and full of childish need.\\nWe look beyond the earth to great worlds\\nThe Tesseract will avail.\\nYou don't have the Tesseract yet.\\nI don't threaten.\\nBut until I open the doors,\\nuntil your force is mine to command, you are the wars.\\n- You will have your war as guardian.\\nIf you fail, -\\nif the Tesseract is kept from us,\\nthere will be no realm, no barren moon,\\nno crevasse where I can't find you.\\nYou think you know pain?\\nYou will receive something sweet as pain.\\n- Get your captain equipment.\\n- All right.\\nAgent Romanoff , he's Captain Rogers.\\n- They need you on the bridge.\\n- See you there.\\nThere was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.\\nI thought Coulson was gonna swoon.\\nDid he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?\\n- Trading Cards?\\n- They're vintage, he's very proud.\\nDr. Banner.\\nOh, yeah. Hi.\\n- They told me you'd be coming.\\n- Word is you can find the cube.\\n- Is that the only word on me?\\n- Only word I care about.\\nMust be strange for you, all of this.\\n- Well, this is actually kind of familiar.\\n- Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute.\\nIt's gonna get a little hard to breath.\\nIs this is a submarine?\\nReally? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container?\\nOh, no. This is much worse.\\n- All engine operating.SHEILD\\nemergency protocol,1 9 3.6 in effect. We're in, sir.\\n- Good.\\n- Lets vanish.\\n- Engage retro reflection panels.\\n- Reflection panels engaged.\\n- Gentlemen.\\n- Doctor, thank you for coming.\\n- Thanks for asking nicely.\\n- So, uh...how long am I staying?\\n- Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear.\\nWhere are you with that?\\nWe're sweeping every\\nwirelessly accessible camera on the planet.\\nCell phones, laptops. If it's connected to a satellite,\\n- it's eyes and ears for us.\\n- That's still not gonna find them in time.\\nYou have to narrow the field.\\nHow many spectrometers do you have access to?\\n- How many are there?\\n- Call every lab you know,\\ntell them to put the spectrometers on the roof\\nand calibrate them for gamma rays.\\nI'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition.\\nAt least we could rule out a few places.\\n- Do you have somewhere for me to work?\\n- Agent Romanoff,\\nwould you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please.\\nYou're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.\\n- Put over there.\\n- Is this the stuff you need?\\n- Yeah, Iridium.\\nIt's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons.\\n- It's very hard to get hold of\\n- Specially if SHIELD knows you need it.\\nWell, I didn't know!\\nThe Tesseract is showing me so much.\\nIt's...it's more than knowledge, it's truth.\\nI know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?\\n- My next target.\\n- Tell me what you need.\\nI need a distraction.\\nAnd an eyeball.\\nI mean, if it's not too much trouble.\\nNo, no. It's fine.\\nIt's a vintage set.\\nIt took me a couple of years to collect them all.\\nNear mint, slight foxing around the edges, but...\\nWe got a hit. Sixty seven percent match.\\nWeight, cross match, seventy nine percent.\\n- Location?\\n- Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Canning Strasse.\\n- He's not exactly hiding.\\n- Captain,\\nyou're up.\\nKneel before me.\\nI said.\\nKneel!\\nIs not this simpler?\\nIs this not your natural state?\\nIt's the unspoken truth of humanity,\\nthat you crave subjugation.\\nThe bright lure of freedom diminishes\\nyour life's joy in a mad scramble for power,\\nand identity.\\nYou were made to be ruled.\\nIn the end, you will always kneel.\\nNot to men like you.\\n- There are no men like me.\\n- There are always men like you.\\nLook to your elder, people.\\nLet him be an example.\\nYou know, the last time I was in Germany\\nand saw a man standing above everybody else,\\nwe ended up disagreeing.\\nI'm not the one who's out of time.\\nLoki, drop the weapon and stand down.\\nKneel.\\nNot today!\\nThe guy's all over the place.\\nAgent Romanoff, did you miss me?\\nMake your move, Reindeer names.\\nGood move.\\n- Mr Stark.\\n- Captain.\\n- Didn't he say anything?\\n- Not a word.\\nJust get in here.\\nWe're low on time.\\n- I don't like it.\\n- What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?\\nI don't remember it being that easy.\\nThis guy packs a wallop.\\nStill, you were pretty spry, for an older fellow.\\n- What's your thing? Pilates?\\n- What?\\nIt's like calisthenics.\\nYou might have missed a couple things,\\nyou know, doing time as a Capsicle.\\n- Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.\\n- Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.\\nWhere's this coming from?\\nWhat's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?\\nI'm not overly fond of what follows.\\n- Now there's that guy.\\n- Another Asgardian?\\n- Think the guy's a friendly?\\n- Doesn't matter.\\nIf he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost.\\n- Stark, we need a plan of attack.\\n- I have a plan. Attack.\\n- I'd sit this one out, Cap.\\n- I don't see how I can.\\nThese guys come from legends, they're basically Gods.\\nThere's only one God, ma'am.\\nAnd I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.\\n- Where's the Tesseract?\\n- I missed you too.\\n- Do I look to be in a gaming mood?\\n- Oh, you should thank me.\\nWith the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy did the\\nAll-Father have to muster to conjure you here?\\nYour precious earth.\\nI thought you dead.\\nDid you mourn?\\n- We all did.\\nOur father...\\n- Your father.\\nHe did tell you my true parentage, did he not?\\nWe were raised together.\\nWe played together, we fought together.\\n- Do you remember none of that?\\n- I remember a shadows.\\nliving in the shade of your greatness.\\nI remember you tossing me into an abyss.\\n- I who was and should be king!\\n- So you take the world I love as recompense for\\nyour imagined slights?\\nNo, the earth is under my protection, Loki.\\nAnd you're doing a marvelous job with that.\\nThe humans slaughter each other in droves, while you ideally threat.\\n- I mean to rule them. That's why should I not...\\n- Think yourself above them.\\n- Well, yes.\\n- Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.\\nA throne would suit you ill.\\nI've seen worlds you've never known about.\\nI have grown, Odin's son, in my exile.\\nI have seen the true power of the Tesseract. And when I wield it...\\nWho showed you this power?\\nWho controls the would be king?\\n- I am the king!\\n- Not here!\\nYou give up the Tesseract!\\nYou give up this poisonous dream!\\nYou come home.\\nI do not have it.\\nYou need the cube to bring me home,\\nbut I've sent it off.

Until then,\\nstay out of the way.\\nTourist.\\nOkay.\\nHow about that.\\nThats enough!\\n- Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.\\n- I've come here to put and end to Loki's schemes!\\nThen prove it. Put that hammer down.\\nUh...yep! No! Bad call! He loves his hammer!\\nYou want me to put the hammer down?\\nAre we done here?\\nIn case it's unclear, you try to escape,\\nyou so much as scratch that glass.\\nThirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap.\\nYou get how that works?\\nAnt.\\nBoot.\\nIt's an impressive cage.\\nNot built, I think, for me.\\nBuilt for something a lot stronger than you.\\nOh, I've heard.\\nThe mindless beast, makes play to be the man.\\nHow desperate are you? You call on these lost creatures to defend you.\\nHow desperate am I?\\nYou threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control.\\nYou talk about peace and you kill\\ncause it's fun.\\nYou have made me very desperate.\\nYou might not be glad that you did.\\nOoh. It burns you to come so close.\\nTo have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power.\\nAnd for what?\\nA world for all mankind to share,\\n- and then to be reminded what real power is.\\n\\\\- Well let me know if real power will want some magazine or something./\\n- He really grows on you, doesn't he?\\n- Loki's gonna drag this out.\\n- So, Thor, what's his play?\\n- He has an army called the Chitauri,\\nthat none of Asgard nor any world know.\\nHe means to lead them against your people. They will win him the earth.\\n- Return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.\\n- An army,\\n- from outer space.\\n- So he's building another portal.\\n- That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.\\n- Selvig?\\n- He's an astrophysicist.\\n- He's a friend.\\nLoki has him under some kind of spell,\\n- along with one of ours.\\n- I wanna know why Loki let us take him.\\n- He's not leading an army from here.\\n- I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.\\nThat guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.\\nI don't care how you speak.\\nLoki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother.\\nHe killed eighty people in two days.\\n- He's adopted.\\n- I think its about the mechanics.\\n- Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?\\n- It's a stabilizing agent.\\nMeans the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD.\\nNo hard feelings Point Break, you've got a mean swing.\\nAlso, it means the portal can open as wide,\\nand stay open as long, as Loki wants.\\nThat man is playing gallaga.\\nThought we wouldn't notice, but we did.\\n- How does Fury even see these?\\n- He turns.\\nSounds exhausting.\\nThe rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.\\nOnly major component he still needs is a power source.\\nA high energy density, something to kick start the cube.\\nWhen did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?\\nLast night.\\nThe packet, Selvig's notes,\\nthe Extraction Theory papers.\\nAm I the only one who did the reading?\\nDoes Loki need any particular kind of power source?\\nHe got to heat the cube to a hundred and\\ntwenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.\\nUnless, Selvig has figured out how to\\nstabilize the quantum tunnelling effect.\\nWell, if he could do that he could achieve\\nHeavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.\\nFinally, someone who speaks English.\\n- Is that what just happened?\\n- It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.\\nYou're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled.\\nAnd I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control\\nand turn into an enormous green rage monster.\\n- Thanks.\\n- Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube.\\n- I was hoping you might join him.\\n- Let's start with that stick of his\\nIt may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a Hydra weapon.\\nI don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube.\\nAnd I'd like to know how Loki used it to\\nturn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.\\n- Monkeys? I do not understand.\\n- I do.\\n- I understood that reference.\\n- Shall we play it, Doctor?\\n- This way, Sir.\\nThe gamma readings are definitely\\nconsistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract.\\n- But it's gonna take weeks to process.\\n- If we bypass their mainframe\\nand direct a reroute to the Homer cluster,\\nwe can clock this around six hundred teraflops.\\nAll I packed was a tooth brush.\\nYou know, you should come by Stark Towers sometime.Top ten floors, all R and D.\\n- You'd love it, it's candy land.\\n- Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I\\nkind of broke Harlem.\\nWell, I promise a stress free environment. No tension.\\nNo surprises.\\n- Nothing?\\n- Are you nuts?\\nYou really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret?\\n- Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?\\n- Is everything a joke to you?\\n- Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny.\\n- No offense, Doctor.\\n- No, it....it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't\\n- handle pointy things.\\n- You're tiptoeing, big man.\\n- You need to strut.\\n- And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.\\nYou think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now?\\nWhy not before? What isn't he telling us.\\nI can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.\\n- You think Fury's hiding something?\\n- He is a spy.\\nHe's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets.\\nIt's bugging him too, isn't it?\\n- Uh, I just wanna finish my work here and...\\n- Doctor?\\nA world for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube.\\n- I heard it.\\n- Well, I think that was meant for you.\\nEven if Barton didn't post that all over the news.\\nThe Stark Tower? That big ugly......, building in New York?\\nIt's powered by Stark Reactors, self sustaining energy source.\\n- That building will run itself for what, a year?\\n- That's just the prototype.\\nI'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.\\nSo why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project?\\nI mean, What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?\\nI should probably look into that once my decryption programme finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.\\n- I'm sorry, did you say.....?\\n- Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.\\nIn a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.\\n- Blueberry?\\n- Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?\\nAn intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically not possible.\\nI think Loki's trying to wind us up.\\nThis is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed.\\nWe have orders, we should follow them.\\nFollowing is not really my style.\\nAnd you're all about style, aren't you?\\nOf the people in this room, which one is; a-wearing a spangly outfit, and b- not of use?\\nSteve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?\\nJust find the cube.\\nThat's the guy my dad never shut up about?\\nWondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.\\nThe guy's not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us.\\nWhat he's got is an acme dynamite kit.\\nIt's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does..\\nAnd I'll read all about it.\\nOr you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.\\nAh, see. I don't get a suit of armor.\\nI'm exposed, like a nerve.\\n- It's a nightmare.\\n- You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel,\\ntrying every second to crawl its way into my heart.\\nThis stops it. This little circle of light.\\nIt's part of me now, not just armor.\\n- It's a terrible privilege.\\n- But you can control it.\\n- Because I learned how.\\n- It's different.\\nHey, I've read all about your accident. That much gammer exposure should have killed you.\\nSo you're saying that the Hulk,\\nthe other guy, saved my life?\\nThat's nice.\\nIt's a nice sentiment.\\nSave it for what?\\nI guess we'll find out.\\n- You may not enjoy that.\\n- You just might.\\nAs soon as Loki took the doctor we moved Jane Foster.\\nWe've got an excellent observatory in Traunsee.\\nShe was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.\\nHandsome fee, private plane, very remote.\\n- She'll be safe.\\n- Thank you.\\nIt's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig.\\nI dread what he plans for him once he's done.\\n- Erik is a good man.\\n- He talks about you a lot.\\nYou changed his life.\\n- You changed everything around here.\\n- They were better as they were.\\nWe pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we.\\nWe come here battling like Bilchsteim.\\n- Like what?\\n- Bilchsteim. You know; huge, scaly, big antlers.\\n- You don't have those?\\n- I don't think so.\\nThey are repulsive, and\\nthey trample everything in their path.\\nWhen I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price.\\nAnd now again,\\nn my youth I courted war.\\nWar hasn't started yet.\\nYou think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is?\\nI do not know. Loki's mind is far afield,\\nit's not just power he craves,\\nit's vengeance upon me.\\nThere's no pain that would prise his need from him.\\nA lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.\\n- What are you asking me to do?\\n- I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?\\nLoki is a prisoner.\\nThen why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?\\nThere's not many people that can sneak up on me.\\n-But you figured I'd come after.\\nAfter whatever tortures Fury can concoct,\\nyou would appear as a friend,\\nas a balm.\\n- And I would cooperate.\\n- I wanna know what you've done to Agent Barton.\\nI'd say I've expanded his mind.\\nAnd once you've won. Once you're king of the mountain.\\nWhat happens to his mind?\\n- Is this love, Agent Romanoff?\\n- Love is for children. I owe him a debt.\\nTell me.\\nBefore I worked for SHIELD, I\\nI made a name for myself.\\nI have a very specific skillset.\\nI didn't care who I used it for, or on.\\nI got on SHIELD's radar in a bad way.\\nAgent Barton was sent to kill me,\\nhe made a different call.\\nAnd what will you do if I vow to spare him?\\n- I'll not let you out.\\n- Ah, no. But I like this\\nYour world in the balance, and you bargain for one man?\\nRegime's fall everyday.\\nI tend not to weep over that, I'm Russian,\\nOr I was.\\n- And what are you now?\\n- It's really not that complicated.\\nI've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.\\nCan you?\\nCan you wipe out that much red?\\nDrakoff's daughter?\\nSao Paulo?\\nThe hospital file?\\nBarton told me everything.\\nYour ledger is dripping, it's gushing red,\\nand you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything?\\nThis is the basest sentimentality.\\nThis is a child at prayer.\\nPathetic.\\nYou lie and kill\\nin the service of liars and killers.\\nYou pretend to be separate,\\nto have your own code,\\nsomething that makes up for the horrors.\\nBut they are a part of you,\\nand they will never go away.\\nI won't barter Barton! Not until I make him kill you.\\nSlowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear.\\nAnd then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work,\\nand when he screams I'll split his skull\\nThis is my bargain, you mewling quin!\\nYou're a monster.\\nOh, no.\\nYou brought the monster.\\n- So, Banner? That's your play?\\n- What?\\nLoki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way.\\nSet the door locked.\\nThank you, for your cooperation.\\n- What are you doing, Mr. Stark?\\n- kind of been wondering the same thing about you\\n- You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.\\n- We are, the model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now.\\nWhen we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.\\nAnd you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss.\\nWhat is Phase 2?\\nPhase 2 is SHIELD used the cube to make weapons.\\n-Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow for me.\\n-Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.This does not\\n\\\\ - mean that we're./\\n- I'm sorry, Nick.\\nWhat were you lying?\\n- I was wrong, Director. The world hasn't changed a bit.\\n- Do you know about this?\\n- You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?\\n- I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.\\n- Loki's manipulating you.\\n- And you've been doing what exactly?\\n- You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.\\n- Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.\\nI'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.\\nBecause of him.\\n- Me?\\n- Last year earth had a visitor from another planet\\nwho had a grudge mass that levelled a small town.\\nWe learned that not only are we not alone,\\nbut we are hopelessly, hilariously\\n- out gunned.\\n- My people want nothing but peace with your planet.\\nBut you're not the only people out there, are you?\\nAnd, you're not the only threat.\\nThe world's filling up with people who can't be matched,\\n- they can't be controlled.\\n- Like you controlled the cube?\\nYou're work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.\\nIt is the signal to all the realms that the\\nearth is ready for a higher form of war.\\n- A higher form?\\n- You forced our hand.We had to come up with something.\\nA nuclear deterrent.\\ncause that always calms everything right down.\\nRemind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?\\n- I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck deep...\\n- Wait, Wait, Hold on. How is this now about me?\\n- I'm sorry, isn't everything?\\n- I thought humans were more evolved than this.\\n- Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?\\n- We can..\\n- You speak of control, yet you court chaos.\\n- It's his M.O., isn't it?\\nI mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.\\nWe're...we're a time-bomb.\\n- You need to step away.\\n- Why shouldn't they guy let off a little steam?\\n- You know damn well why! Back off!\\n- Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.\\nYeah, big man in a suit of armor.\\n- Take that off, what are you?\\n- Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.\\nI know guys with none of that worth ten of you.\\nI've seen the footage.\\nThe only thing you really fight for is yourself.\\nYou're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,\\nto lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.\\nI think I would just cut the wire.\\nAlways a way out.\\nYou know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero\\nA hero, like you?\\nYou're a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle.\\nPut on the suite, let's go a few rounds.\\n- You people are so petty, and tiny.\\n- Yes, right.\\n- Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr. Banner back to his\\n- Where? You're renting my room.\\n- The cell was just...\\n- In case you needed to kill me.\\nbut you can't! I know, I tried.\\nI got low,\\nI didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out.\\nSo I moved on, I focused on helping other people.\\nI was good until you dragged me back into this freak show.\\nand put everyone here at risk. You wanna know my secret,\\nAgent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?\\nDr. Banner.\\nput down the scepter.\\nAll right.\\n- Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my party trick after all.\\n- Located the Tesseract?\\n- I can get there faster.\\n- The Tesseract belongs on Asgard,\\n- no human is a match for it.\\n- You're not going alone!\\nYou gonna stop me?\\nPut on the suit, let's find out.\\n- I'm not afraid to hit an old man.\\n- Put on the suit.\\nOh, my God.\\n- Put on the suit!\\n- Yep.\\n- Hill!\\n- Its a detonation. Number three engines is down.\\n-We're been hit.\\n-Fire engines.\\n- Talk to me.\\n- Turbine looks mostly intact, -\\nbut it is impossible to get out there and repair when we already there.\\nIf we lose one of engine we wont be.\\n- Someone gonna get outside and patch the engine.\\n- Stark, did you capy that?\\n- I'm on it.\\nOkay.\\nYou okay right?\\nKeep that engine down.\\nAttention.wait the cameras going dark.\\nStay close.\\nLevel four.\\nEngine three. I'll meet you there.\\nDoctor.\\nBruce, you gotta fight.\\nThis is just what Loki wants.\\nWe're gonna be okay. Listen to me.\\nWe're gonna be okay.

Should we test that?\\nMove away please.\\nDo you like this?\\nWe started working on the prototype after you sent The Destroyer.\\nEven I don't know what it does.\\nDo you wanna find out?\\nNo!\\nNatasha ...\\nYou're gonna lose.\\nAm I?\\nIt's in your nature.\\nYou're heroes are scattered,\\nyour floating fortress falls from the sky.\\n- Where is my disadvantage?\\n- Your lack conviction.\\nI don't think I...\\nSo that's what it does.\\n- Cap, need a lever.\\n- I need a minute here!\\nLever, now!\\nI'm sorry, boss.

Our communications,\\nlocation of the cube,\\nBanner, Thor. I got nothing for you.\\nLost my one good eye.\\nMaybe I had that coming.\\nYes.\\nWe were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.\\nI never put all my chips on that number though,\\nbecause I was playing something even riskier.\\nThere was an idea, Stark knows this,\\ncalled The Avengers Initiative.\\nThe idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people,\\nsee if they could become something more.\\nSee if they could work together when we needed them to,\\nto fight the battles that we never could.\\nPhil Coulson died still believing in that idea,\\nin heroes.\\nWell, it's an old fashioned notion.\\nYou fell out of the sky.\\n- Did I hurt anybody?\\n- There's nobody around here to get hurt.\\nYou did scare the hell out of some pigeons though.\\n- Lucky.\\n- Or just good aim.\\nYou were awake when you fell.\\n- You saw?\\n- The whole thing, right through the ceiling.\\nBig and green and buck ass nude.\\nHere...\\nI didn't think those would fit you until\\nyou shrunk down to a regular size fella.\\nThank you.\\n- Are you an alien?\\n- What?\\n- From outer space, an alien?\\n- No.\\nWell then, son.

Don't do that to yourself, Clint.\\nThis is Loki.\\nThis is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for.\\n- Loki, he got away?\\n- Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?\\nI didn't need to know. I didn't ask.\\nHe's gonna make his play soon though. Today.\\n- We gotta stop him.\\n- Yeah? Who's we?\\nI don't know. Who's ever left.\\nWell, if I put an arrow in Loki's eye socket, I'd sleep better I suppose.\\nNow you sound like you.\\nBut you don't.\\nYou're a spy, not a soldier.\\nNow you want to wade into a war. Why?\\nWhat did Loki do to you?\\nHe didn't, I just...\\nNatasha.\\nI've been compromised.\\nI got red in my ledger,\\nI'd like to wipe it out.\\n- Was he married?\\n- No\\nHe was a...cellist, I think.\\nI'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.\\n- He was an idiot.\\n- Why? For believing?\\n- For taking on Loki alone.\\n- He was doing his job.\\nHe was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have...\\n- Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.\\n- Right. How did that work for him?\\n- Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?\\n- We're not soldiers!\\n- I'm not marching to Fury's fife.\\n- Neither am I.\\nHe's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does,\\nbut right now we gotta put that behind us and get this done.\\nNow Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list...\\nHe made it personal.\\n- That's not the point.\\n- That is the point. That's Loki's point.\\n- He hit us all right where we live. Why?\\n- To tear us apart.\\nHe had to conquer his greed,\\nbut he knows he has to take us out to win, right?\\nThat's what he wants. He wants to beat us,\\nhe wants to be seen doing it.\\n- He wants an audience.\\n- Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.\\nYeah. That's just previews, this is...\\nthis is opening night. And Loki, he's a full-tail diva.\\nHe wants flowers, he wants parades,\\nhe wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered.\\nI hope that would be true.\\n- Time to go.\\n- Go where?\\nI'll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets?\\nI can.\\nYou got a suit? Yeah.\\nThen suit up.\\n- You guys aren't authorized to be in here.\\n- Son, just don't.\\nSir.\\nDone is jacket.\\nRanugal\\nRanugal\\nThey needed to push.\\nThey found it.

Threatening.\\nThe Chitauri are coming, nothing will change that.\\n- What have I to fear?\\n- The Avengers.\\nIt's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team.\\nEarth's Mightiest Heroes type of thing.\\n- Yes, I've met them.\\n- Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one.\\nBut, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God\\na super soldier, a living legend\\nwho kind of lives up to the legend\\na man with breath-taking anger management issues\\na couple of master assassins, and you, big fella\\nyou've managed to piss off every single one of them.\\n- That was the plan.\\n- Not a great plan.\\nWhen they come, and they will, they'll come for you.\\n- I have an army.\\n- We have a Hulk.\\n-I thought the beast had wandered off.\\n-You're missing the point. There's no throne,\\nthere is no version of this, where you come out on top.\\nMaybe your army comes and\\nmaybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you.\\nBecause if we can't protect the Earth,\\nyou can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.\\nHow will your friends have time for me,\\nwhen they're so busy fighting you?\\n- It should work!\\n- Well, performance issues. You know?\\nJarvis, anytime now.\\n- You will all fall before me.\\nAnd there's one other person you pissed off!\\nHis name is Phil.\\nRight.\\nArmy.\\nLoki, turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it!\\nYou can't.\\nThere is no stopping it.\\n- There is only the war!\\n- So be it.\\n- Stark, we're heading north east.\\n- What, did you stop for drive-through?\\nSwing that park, I'm gonna lay them out for you.\\n- So we have more incoming.\\n- Lets keep them occupied.\\n- Nat.\\n- Did you see them?\\nWe need back up there.\\n- Stark, are you seeing this?\\n- I'm seeing, still working on believing..\\n- Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?\\n- Banner?\\nJust keep me posted.\\nJarvis, find me a soft spot.\\nLook at this. Look around you.\\nYou think this madness will end with your rule?\\nIt's too late.

Go Go.\\n- You think you can hold them off?\\nCaptain,\\nit would be my genuine pleasure.\\n- Just like Budapest all over again!\\n- You and I remember Budapest very differently.\\nNational guard?\\nDoes the army know what's happening here?\\nDo we?\\nI need men in these buildings. There are people inside that can run into the line of fire.\\nYou take them through the basement or through the subway, you keep them off the streets\\n- I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.\\n- Why the hell should I take orders from you?\\nI need men in those buildings, lead the people down and away from the streets\\nI wanna shut off the perimeter all the way down of 39 Street.\\nWell, we got its attention.\\nWhere it heads to?\\n- Lets Thor hear what says.\\n- The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable\\nThor is right, we gotta deal with these guys.\\n- How do we do this? As a team.\\n- I have unfinished business with Loki.\\n- Yeah, get in line.\\n- Save it.\\nSave it. Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's what we need. Without him these things could run wild.\\nWe got Stark up top, he's gonna need us...\\nSo, this all seems horrible.\\n- I've seen worse.\\n- Sorry.\\nNo, we could use a little worse.\\n- Stark, we got him,\\n- Banne.\\n- just like you said.\\n- Tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.\\nI don't see how that's a party.\\nDr. Banner,\\nDr. Banner, now might be a good time for you to get angry.\\nThat's my secret, Captain.\\nI'm always angry.\\nHold on.\\nSend the rest.\\nGuys.\\n- Call it, Captain.\\nAlright, listen up. Until we can close that portal up there, we're gonna use containment.\\nBarton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.\\nStark, you got the perimeter.

from?\\nwhat's the matter? scared of a little lightning?\\ni'm not overly fond of what follows.\\n- now there's that guy.\\n- another asgardian?\\n- think the guy's a friendly?\\n- doesn't matter.\\nif he frees loki or kills him, the tesseract's lost.\\n- stark, we need a plan of attack.\\n- i have a plan. attack.\\n- i'd sit this one out, cap.\\n- i don't see how i can.\\nthese guys come from legends, they're basically gods.\\nthere's only one god, ma'am.\\nand i'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.\\n- where's the tesseract?\\n- i missed you too.\\n- do i look to be in a gaming mood?\\n- oh, you should thank me.\\nwith the bifrost gone, how much dark energy did the\\nall-father have to muster to conjure you here?\\nyour precious earth.\\ni thought you dead.\\ndid you mourn?\\n- we all did.\\nour father...\\n- your father.\\nhe did tell you my true parentage, did he not?\\nwe were raised together.\\nwe played together, we fought together.\\n- do you remember none of that?\\n- i remember a shadows.\\nliving in the shade of your greatness.\\ni remember you tossing me into an abyss.\\n- i who was and should be king!\\n- so you take the world i love as recompense for\\nyour imagined slights?\\nno, the earth is under my protection, loki.\\nand you're doing a marvelous job with that.\\nthe humans slaughter each other in droves, while you ideally threat.\\n- i mean to rule them. that's why should i not...\\n- think yourself above them.\\n- well, yes.\\n- then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.\\na throne would suit you ill.\\ni've seen worlds you've never known about.\\ni have grown, odin's son, in my exile.\\ni have seen the true power of the tesseract. and when i wield it...\\nwho showed you this power?\\nwho controls the would be king?\\n- i am the king!\\n- not here!\\nyou give up the tesseract!\\nyou give up this poisonous dream!\\nyou come home.\\ni do not have it.\\nyou need the cube to bring me home,\\nbut i've sent it off. i know not where.\\nyou listen well, brother.\\ni'm listening.\\n- do not touch me again.\\n- then don't take my stuff.\\nyou have no idea what you're dealing with.\\nuh...shakespeare in the park.\\ndoth mother know, you weareth her drapes?\\nthis is beyond you, metal man.\\nloki will face asgardian justice.\\nhe gives up the cube and he's all yours. until then,\\nstay out of the way.\\ntourist.\\nokay.\\nhow about that.\\nthats enough!\\n- now, i don't know what you plan on doing here.\\n- i've come here to put and end to loki's schemes!\\nthen prove it. put that hammer down.\\nuh...yep! no! bad call! he loves his hammer!\\nyou want me to put the hammer down?\\nare we done here?\\nin case it's unclear, you try to escape,\\nyou so much as scratch that glass.\\nthirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap.\\nyou get how that works?\\nant.\\nboot.\\nit's an impressive cage.\\nnot built, i think, for me.\\nbuilt for something a lot stronger than you.\\noh, i've heard.\\nthe mindless beast, makes play to be the man.\\nhow desperate are you? you call on these lost creatures to defend you.\\nhow desperate am i?\\nyou threaten my world with war. you steal a force you can't hope to control.\\nyou talk about peace and you kill\\ncause it's fun.\\nyou have made me very desperate.\\nyou might not be glad that you did.\\nooh. it burns you to come so close.\\nto have the tesseract, to have power, unlimited power.\\nand for what?\\na world for all mankind to share,\\n- and then to be reminded what real power is.\\n\\\\- well let me know if real power will want some magazine or something./\\n- he really grows on you, doesn't he?\\n- loki's gonna drag this out.\\n- so, thor, what's his play?\\n- he has an army called the chitauri,\\nthat none of asgard nor any world know.\\nhe means to lead them against your people. they will win him the earth.\\n- return, i suspect, for the tesseract.\\n- an army,\\n- from outer space.\\n- so he's building another portal.\\n- that's what he needs erik selvig for.\\n- selvig?\\n- he's an astrophysicist.\\n- he's a friend.\\nloki has him under some kind of spell,\\n- along with one of ours.\\n- i wanna know why loki let us take him.\\n- he's not leading an army from here.\\n- i don't think we should be focusing on loki.\\nthat guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.\\ni don't care how you speak.\\nloki is beyond reason, but he is of asgard, and he's my brother.\\nhe killed eighty people in two days.\\n- he's adopted.\\n- i think its about the mechanics.\\n- iridium, what did they need the iridium for?\\n- it's a stabilizing agent.\\nmeans the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at shield.\\nno hard feelings point break, you've got a mean swing.\\nalso, it means the portal can open as wide,\\nand stay open as long, as loki wants.\\nthat man is playing gallaga.\\nthought we wouldn't notice, but we did.\\n- how does fury even see these?\\n- he turns.\\nsounds exhausting.\\nthe rest of the raw materials, agent barton can get his hands on pretty easily.\\nonly major component he still needs is a power source.\\na high energy density, something to kick start the cube.\\nwhen did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?\\nlast night.\\nthe packet, selvig's notes,\\nthe extraction theory papers.\\nam i the only one who did the reading?\\ndoes loki need any particular kind of power source?\\nhe got to heat the cube to a hundred and\\ntwenty million kelvin just to break through the coulomb barrier.\\nunless, selvig has figured out how to\\nstabilize the quantum tunnelling effect.\\nwell, if he could do that he could achieve\\nheavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.\\nfinally, someone who speaks english.\\n- is that what just happened?\\n- it's good to meet you, dr. banner.\\nyou're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled.\\nand i'm a huge fan of the way you lose control\\nand turn into an enormous green rage monster.\\n- thanks.\\n- dr. banner is only here to track the cube.\\n- i was hoping you might join him.\\n- let's start with that stick of his\\nit may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a hydra weapon.\\ni don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube.\\nand i'd like to know how loki used it to\\nturn two of the sharpest men i know into his personal flying monkeys.\\n- monkeys? i do not understand.\\n- i do.\\n- i understood that reference.\\n- shall we play it, doctor?\\n- this way, sir.\\nthe gamma readings are definitely\\nconsistent with selvig's reports on the tesseract.\\n- but it's gonna take weeks to process.\\n- if we bypass their mainframe\\nand direct a reroute to the homer cluster,\\nwe can clock this around six hundred teraflops.\\nall i packed was a tooth brush.\\nyou know, you should come by stark towers sometime.top ten floors, all r and d.\\n- you'd love it, it's candy land.\\n- thanks, but the last time i was in new york i\\nkind of broke harlem.\\nwell, i promise a stress free environment. no tension.\\nno surprises.\\n- nothing?\\n- are you nuts?\\nyou really have got a lid on it, haven't you? what's your secret?\\n- mellow jazz? bongo drums? huge bag of weed?\\n- is everything a joke to you?\\n- threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny.\\n- no offense, doctor.\\n- no, it....it's alright. i wouldn't have come aboard if i couldn't\\n- handle pointy things.\\n- you're tiptoeing, big man.\\n- you need to strut.\\n- and you need to focus on the problem, mr. stark.\\nyou think i'm not? why did fury call us and why now?\\nwhy not before? what isn't he telling us.\\ni can't do the equation unless i have all the variables.\\n- you think fury's hiding something?\\n- he is a spy.\\nhe's a spy. captain, he's the spy. his secrets have secrets.\\nit's bugging him too, isn't it?\\n- uh, i just wanna finish my work here and...\\n- doctor?\\na world for all mankind, loki's jab at fury about the cube.\\n- i heard it.\\n- well, i think that was meant for you.\\neven if barton didn't post that all over the news.\\nthe stark tower? that big ugly......, building in new york?\\nit's powered by stark reactors, self sustaining energy source.\\n- that building will run itself for what, a year?\\n- that's just the prototype.\\ni'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.\\nso why didn't shield bring him in on the tesseract project?\\ni mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place?\\ni should probably look into that once my decryption programme finishes breaking into all of shield's secure files.\\n- i'm sorry, did you say.....?\\n- jarvis has been running it since i hit the bridge.\\nin a few hours we'll know every dirty secret shield has ever tried to hide.\\n- blueberry?\\n- yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?\\nan intelligence organization that fears intelligence? historically not possible.\\ni think loki's trying to wind us up.\\nthis is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed.\\nwe have orders, we should follow them.\\nfollowing is not really my style.\\nand you're all about style, aren't you?\\nof the people in this room, which one is; a-wearing a spangly outfit, and b- not of use?\\nsteve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?\\njust find the cube.\\nthat's the guy my dad never shut up about?\\nwondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.\\nthe guy's not wrong about loki, he does have the jump on us.\\nwhat he's got is an acme dynamite kit.\\nit's gonna blow up in his face, and i'm gonna be there when it does..\\nand i'll read all about it.\\nor you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.\\nah, see. i don't get a suit of armor.\\ni'm exposed, like a nerve.\\n- it's a nightmare.\\n- you know, i've got a cluster of shrapnel,\\ntrying every second to crawl its way into my heart.\\nthis stops it. this little circle of light.\\nit's part of me now, not just armor.\\n- it's a terrible privilege.\\n- but you can control it.\\n- because i learned how.\\n- it's different.\\nhey, i've read all about your accident. that much gammer exposure should have killed you.\\nso you're saying that the hulk,\\nthe other guy, saved my life?\\nthat's nice.\\nit's a nice sentiment.\\nsave it for what?\\ni guess we'll find out.\\n- you may not enjoy that.\\n- you just might.\\nas soon as loki took the doctor we moved jane foster.\\nwe've got an excellent observatory in traunsee.\\nshe was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.\\nhandsome fee, private plane, very remote.\\n- she'll be safe.\\n- thank you.\\nit's no accident loki taking erik selvig.\\ni dread what he plans for him once he's done.\\n- erik is a good man.\\n- he talks about you a lot.\\nyou changed his life.\\n- you changed everything around here.\\n- they were better as they were.\\nwe pretend on asgard that we're more advanced, but we.\\nwe come here battling like bilchsteim.\\n- like what?\\n- bilchsteim. you know; huge, scaly, big antlers.\\n- you don't have those?\\n- i don't think so.\\nthey are repulsive, and\\nthey trample everything in their path.\\nwhen i first came to earth, loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price.\\nand now again,\\nn my youth i courted war.\\nwar hasn't started yet.\\nyou think you can make loki tell us what the tesseract is?\\ni do not know. loki's mind is far afield,\\nit's not just power he craves,\\nit's vengeance upon me.\\nthere's no pain that would prise his need from him.\\na lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.\\n- what are you asking me to do?\\n- i'm asking, what are you prepared to do?\\nloki is a prisoner.\\nthen why do i feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?\\nthere's not many people that can sneak up on me.\\n-but you figured i'd come after.\\nafter whatever tortures fury can concoct,\\nyou would appear as a friend,\\nas a balm.\\n- and i would cooperate.\\n- i wanna know what you've done to agent barton.\\ni'd say i've expanded his mind.\\nand once you've won. once you're king of the mountain.\\nwhat happens to his mind?\\n- is this love, agent romanoff?\\n- love is for children. i owe him a debt.\\ntell me.\\nbefore i worked for shield, i\\ni made a name for myself.\\ni have a very specific skillset.\\ni didn't care who i used it for, or on.\\ni got on shield's radar in a bad way.\\nagent barton was sent to kill me,\\nhe made a different call.\\nand what will you do if i vow to spare him?\\n- i'll not let you out.\\n- ah, no. but i like this\\nyour world in the balance, and you bargain for one man?\\nregime's fall everyday.\\ni tend not to weep over that, i'm russian,\\nor i was.\\n- and what are you now?\\n- it's really not that complicated.\\ni've got red in my ledger, i'd like to wipe it out.\\ncan you?\\ncan you wipe out that much red?\\ndrakoff's daughter?\\nsao paulo?\\nthe hospital file?\\nbarton told me everything.\\nyour ledger is dripping, it's gushing red,\\nand you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything?\\nthis is the basest sentimentality.\\nthis is a child at prayer.\\npathetic.\\nyou lie and kill\\nin the service of liars and killers.\\nyou pretend to be separate,\\nto have your own code,\\nsomething that makes up for the horrors.\\nbut they are a part of you,\\nand they will never go away.\\ni won't barter barton! not until i make him kill you.\\nslowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear.\\nand then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work,\\nand when he screams i'll split his skull\\nthis is my bargain, you mewling quin!\\nyou're a monster.\\noh, no.\\nyou brought the monster.\\n- so, banner? that's your play?\\n- what?\\nloki means to unleash the hulk. keep banner in the lab, i'm on my way.\\nset the door locked.\\nthank you, for your cooperation.\\n- what are you doing, mr. stark?\\n- kind of been wondering the same thing about you\\n- you're supposed to be locating the tesseract.\\n- we are, the model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now.\\nwhen we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.\\nand you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss.\\nwhat is phase 2?\\nphase 2 is shield used the cube to make weapons.\\n-sorry, the computer was moving a little slow for me.\\n-rogers, we gathered everything related to the tesseract.this does not\\n\\\\ - mean that we're./\\n- i'm sorry, nick.\\nwhat were you lying?\\n- i was wrong, director. the world hasn't changed a bit.\\n- do you know about this?\\n- you wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?\\n- i was in calcutta, i was pretty well removed.\\n- loki's manipulating you.\\n- and you've been doing what exactly?\\n- you didn't come here because i bat my eyelashes at you.\\n- yes, and i'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.\\ni'd like to know why shield is using the tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.\\nbecause of him.\\n- me?\\n- last year earth had a visitor from another planet\\nwho had a grudge mass that levelled a small town.\\nwe learned that not only are we not alone,\\nbut we are hopelessly, hilariously\\n- out gunned.\\n- my people want nothing but peace with your planet.\\nbut you're not the only people out there, are you?\\nand, you're not the only threat.\\nthe world's filling up with people who can't be matched,\\n- they can't be controlled.\\n- like you controlled the cube?\\nyou're work with the tesseract is what drew loki to it, and his allies.\\nit is the signal to all the realms that the\\nearth is ready for a higher form of war.\\n- a higher form?\\n- you forced our hand.we had to come up with something.\\na nuclear deterrent.\\ncause that always calms everything right down.\\nremind me again how you made your fortune, stark?\\n- i'm sure if he still made weapons, stark would be neck deep...\\n- wait, wait, hold on. how is this now about me?\\n- i'm sorry, isn't everything?\\n- i thought humans were more evolved than this.\\n- excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?\\n- we can..\\n- you speak of control, yet you court chaos.\\n- it's his m.o., isn't it?\\ni mean, what are we, a team? no, no, no. we're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.\\nwe're...we're a time-bomb.\\n- you need to step away.\\n- why shouldn't they guy let off a little steam?\\n- you know damn well why! back off!\\n- oh, i'm starting to want you to make me.\\nyeah, big man in a suit of armor.\\n- take that off, what are you?\\n- genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.\\ni know guys with none of that worth ten of you.\\ni've seen the footage.\\nthe only thing you really fight for is yourself.\\nyou're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,\\nto lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.\\ni think i would just cut the wire.\\nalways a way out.\\nyou know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero\\na hero, like you?\\nyou're a laboratory experiment, rogers. everything special about you came out of a bottle.\\nput on the suite, let's go a few rounds.\\n- you people are so petty, and tiny.\\n- yes, right.\\n- agent romanoff, would you escort dr. banner back to his\\n- where? you're renting my room.\\n- the cell was just...\\n- in case you needed to kill me.\\nbut you can't! i know, i tried.\\ni got low,\\ni didn't see an end, so i put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out.\\nso i moved on, i focused on helping other people.\\ni was good until you dragged me back into this freak show.\\nand put everyone here at risk. you wanna know my secret,\\nagent romanoff? you wanna know how i stay calm?\\ndr. banner.\\nput down the scepter.\\nall right.\\n- sorry, kids. you don't get to see my party trick after all.\\n- located the tesseract?\\n- i can get there faster.\\n- the tesseract belongs on asgard,\\n- no human is a match for it.\\n- you're not going alone!\\nyou gonna stop me?\\nput on the suit, let's find out.\\n- i'm not afraid to hit an old

you sound like you.\\nbut you don't.\\nyou're a spy, not a soldier.\\nnow you want to wade into a war. why?\\nwhat did loki do to you?\\nhe didn't, i just...\\nnatasha.\\ni've been compromised.\\ni got red in my ledger,\\ni'd like to wipe it out.\\n- was he married?\\n- no\\nhe was a...cellist, i think.\\ni'm sorry. he seemed like a good man.\\n- he was an idiot.\\n- why? for believing?\\n- for taking on loki alone.\\n- he was doing his job.\\nhe was out of his league. he should have waited. he should have...\\n- sometimes there isn't a way out, tony.\\n- right. how did that work for

now we gotta put that behind us and get this done.\\nnow loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list...\\nhe made it personal.\\n- that's not the point.\\n- that is the point. that's loki's point.\\n- he hit us all right where we live. why?\\n- to tear us apart.\\nhe had to conquer his greed,\\nbut he knows he has to take us out to win, right?\\nthat's what he wants. he wants to beat us,\\nhe wants to be seen doing it.\\n- he wants an audience.\\n- right. i caught his act in stuttgart.\\nyeah. that's just previews, this is...\\nthis is opening night. and loki, he's a full-tail diva.\\nhe wants flowers, he wants parades,\\nhe wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered.\\ni hope that would be true.\\n- time to go.\\n- go where?\\ni'll tell you on

legend\\nwho kind of lives up to the legend\\na man with breath-taking anger management issues\\na couple of master assassins, and you, big fella\\nyou've managed to piss off every single one of them.\\n- that was the plan.\\n- not a great plan.\\nwhen they come, and they will, they'll come for you.\\n- i have an army.\\n- we have a hulk.\\n-i thought the beast had wandered off.\\n-you're missing the point. there's no throne,\\nthere is no version of this, where you come out on top.\\nmaybe your army comes and\\nmaybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you.\\nbecause if we can't protect the earth,\\nyou can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.\\nhow will your friends have time for me,\\nwhen they're so busy fighting you?\\n- it should work!\\n- well, performance issues. you know?\\njarvis, anytime now.\\n- you will all fall before me.\\nand there's one other person you pissed off!\\nhis name is phil.\\nright.\\narmy.\\nloki, turn off the tesseract or i'll destroy
